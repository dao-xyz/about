# DAO.xyz - Unifying communities and organization
DAO.xyz is a coordination stack trying to bring services like Discord and Reddit to Web3 and providing utility to control Web3 projects in a truly decentralized and transparent way.
 
## Combining social media and staking
- Protocols handles authentication and governance.
- Content and discoverable through trusted peer to peer networks.
 
## Channels for DAOs
The channels on the platform are intended to serve as communication channels for governance token holders. Posts that exist on the channel are intended to serve as a way of communicating information and/or perform actions after voting.
 
## Channels for non-DAOs (social media channels)
Channels do not necessarily have to be associated with a DAO. The protocol is providing a platform wide utility token that can be used on non-DAO channels (for voting) and on DAO channels that allow non-owners to participate.
 
## Content moderation
Not all content is legal. Information and data that is deemed illegal by common law is to also be moderated on the platform. This will (can) be handled symbolically in the same way illegal companies are handled.
 
To remove content (posts) on a channel owned by a DAO a post with a "delete" action should be created, voted on, and executed (if approved).
 
There has to also be a global governing control to prevent illegal content to threaten the existence of the entire protocol itself. The protocol will control itself through its own DAO channel where these actions can be performed, by the owners of this protocol.
